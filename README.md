## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Discord Bot App ID, Public Key, and Token**  
   To set up a Discord bot, you need to register it in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and add it to your server.

   - **Follow the Discord documentation**: Use [this guide](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app) to create and register the bot app.
   - **Setting Permissions**: Configure the bot’s permissions correctly in the Developer Portal to allow it to join channels, send messages, and use slash commands.
     - Go to **"Installation"** and scroll to **"Default Install Settings"**.
     - Under **"SCOPES"** for *Guild Install*, ensure **"bot"** is selected.
     - In **"PERMISSIONS"**, enable the following options:
       - **Connect**
       - **Send Messages**
       - **Speak**
       - **Use Slash Commands**
       - **View Channels**

2. **OpenAI API Key**  
   Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) to allow the bot to use the Whisper and GPT models.

   - **Follow OpenAI’s documentation**: Use [this guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) to generate your API key.
   - **Note**: OpenAI’s API is a paid service, and usage fees will apply based on the models you use and the volume of requests.

### Server Recommendations
Your server resources will vary depending on the Whisper model you choose and how many recordings you want to process/keep.
These are just general recommendations. Read more about Whisper [here](https://github.com/openai/whisper?tab=readme-ov-file#available-models-and-languages).

### `conf.json` Settings

1. **`inactivityTimeoutMinutes`**  
   Determines the duration, in minutes, for which the bot monitors audio activity during a recording session. If no audio is detected within this timeframe, the session will automatically end due to inactivity.

   - **Type**: Integer  
   - **Default**: `5`  
   - **Example**: Setting this to `10` will keep the session open for 10 minutes without audio before ending.

2. **`sessionNameMaxLength`**  
   Specifies the maximum character length allowed for session names, restricting the length of names given to each scrying session.

   - **Type**: Integer  
   - **Default**: `50`  
   - **Example**: Increasing this value allows for longer session names.

3. **`whisperModel`**  
   Defines the Whisper model used for transcription. Models vary in size and accuracy, with larger models providing better transcription accuracy at the cost of higher computational resources.

   - **Type**: String  
   - **Default**: `"base"`  
   - **Options**: `"tiny"`, `"base"`, `"small"`, `"medium"`, `"large"`  
   - **Example**: Setting this to `"small"` reduces the model size for quicker transcription times.

4. **`openAIModel`**  
   Specifies the OpenAI language model used for generating session summaries. Larger models, such as those in the GPT-4 series, offer more nuanced summaries but may have higher usage limits or API costs. The selected model will affect the quality, detail, and potential cost of the summary generation.

   - **Type**: String  
   - **Default**: `"gpt-4-turbo"`  
   - **Options**:
     - **`"gpt-4-turbo-32k"`**: Ideal for handling very long sessions, with up to 32,768 tokens (approximately 24,576 words per chunk).
     - **`"gpt-4-turbo"`**: Suitable for most sessions, with a limit of 8,192 tokens (approximately 6,144 words per chunk).
     - **`"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"`**: A cost-effective option with up to 16,384 tokens (approximately 12,288 words per chunk).
     - **`"gpt-3.5-turbo"`**: The most budget-friendly choice, best for shorter sessions, with a limit of 4,096 tokens (approximately 3,072 words per chunk).   
   - **Example**: Setting `"gpt-3.5-turbo"` is suitable if you want a faster, more cost-effective model, particularly for shorter summaries.


5. **`saveRecordings`**  
   Determines whether to keep or delete audio recordings after they have been successfully transcribed and summarized. Set to false if you want to automatically delete recordings, reducing storage use, or set to true if you prefer to retain the original audio files for future reference.

   - **Type**: Boolean  
   - **Default**: `"true"`  
   - **Example**: `"False` if you want to automatically delete recordings after they have been transcribed.

6. **`audioQuality`**  
   Controls the quality of audio recordings for transcription, with options to balance between audio clarity and file size. Higher quality settings provide clearer audio but increase storage use. Lower quality is generally sufficient for transcription accuracy while minimizing file size.

   - **Type**: String  
   - **Default**: `"low"`  
   - **Options**: `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`  
   - **Example**: `"high"` for maximum audio clarity if storage space is not a concern, or "low" to minimize file size while maintaining transcribable quality.

# Usage

The bot provides a collection of commands to interact with voice channels and manage transcriptions. Here is a summary of the available commands:

### Commands

1. **`/gaze`**
   - The bot enters the voice channel, peering into the voices of the unseen.

2. **`/leave`**
   - The bot vanishes, ending the magical vision and leaving the voice channel.

3. **`/begin_scrying`**
   - Start recording the words spoken in the channel, capturing them as if seen through a crystal ball.
   - **Options**: 
     - `session`: The name of the session (up to 50 characters, must be unique).

4. **`/end_scrying`**
   - Cease recording, finalizing the vision.

5. **`/consult_the_texts`**
   - Lists all the scrying sessions saved to the wizard's tome.

6. **`/reveal_summary`**
   - Receive a concise vision of the last scrying session.
   - **Options**: 
     - `session`: The name of the session you wish to summarize.

7. **`/complete_vision`**
   - Retrieve the full record of the scryed voices, as written by the orb.
   - **Options**: 
     - `session`: The name of the session you wish to reveal.

8. **`/delete_session`**
   - Deletes all recordings and transcripts for a specific session. Use with caution!
   - **Options**: 
     - `session`: The name of the session you wish to delete.

9. **`/purge`**
   - Deletes all recordings and transcripts for every session. Use with extreme caution!
   - **Options**: 
     - `confirmation`: Type "y" to delete everything! This cannot be undone!


# Example Workflow

Here's an example of how you might use the bot commands to record, summarize, and manage voice channel sessions:

1. **Entering a Voice Channel**:  
   - Use the command `/gaze` to have the bot join the voice channel.

2. **Start Recording**:  
   - Run `/begin_scrying session:YourSessionName` to begin recording the session. Make sure the session name is unique and within 50 characters.

3. **End Recording**:  
   - Use `/end_scrying` to stop the recording when done.

4. **Check Available Sessions**:  
   - Use `/consult_the_texts` to see a list of saved scrying sessions.

5. **Summarize a Session**:  
   - To get a summary of a recorded session, use `/reveal_summary session:YourSessionName`.

6. **Retrieve the Full Transcript**:  
   - Run `/complete_vision session:YourSessionName` to access the full transcription of the session.

7. **Delete a Session**:  
   - Use `/delete_session session:YourSessionName` if you no longer need the recording and transcription for a specific session.

8. **Clear All Sessions**:  
   - With caution, use `/purge confirmation:y` to delete all recordings and transcriptions from every session.


Each command offers a unique interaction with the bot, allowing for seamless integration into your D&D sessions.
